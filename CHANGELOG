	* Enhancement of parsing conservation score file.
	When parsing the conservation score (-cs), if
	the score is a dash ('-'), that means it's value
	is NA and will be omitted.
	* Add positive set support information (number
	of genes with pattern existence / number of total genes)
	to 'clustered_patterns.txt' file.

1.3  2013-12-13  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

        * Add new options: -cs and -sc for conservation scoring.
        * Fix occupancy scoring.
        * Fix the seqid that affect the mi and occupancy scoring.

1.2b  2013-12-13  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

        * New option: applying nucleosome occupancy scores (-oc).
        * New options for PFM similarity calculation: -ws and -gc.

1.1  2013-12-08  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

        * Change the command-line arguments:
            (1) -cluster to -nc
            (2) -n to -np

        * New option: applying sequence mask (-seqmask).
